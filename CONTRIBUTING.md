## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- pnpm package manager
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript, NestJS, and Next.js

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   # Set up backend environment
   cp apps/core-api/.env.example apps/core-api/.env
   
   # Set up frontend environment
   cp apps/pwa/.env.example apps/pwa/.env.local
   
   # Edit .env files with your local configuration
   ```

4. **Start backend (core API):**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter core-api start:dev
   ```

5. **Start frontend (in a second terminal):**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter pwa dev
   ```

### Developing inside the Dev Container

We provide a VS Code Dev Container (and GitHub Codespaces compatibility) so contributors can onboard fast without installing local runtimes. It defines a reproducible Linux environment with all required toolchains and backing services.

#### What Is a Dev Container?
A Dev Container is a Docker-based environment configuration. VS Code builds it and then attaches your editor session inside the container—ensuring everyone uses the same Node version, pnpm, OS packages, and service dependencies (like PostgreSQL & Redis) with zero host pollution.

#### Prerequisites (if NOT using Codespaces)
- Docker Engine / Docker Desktop running
- VS Code + Dev Containers extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)
- Git (to clone & branch)

You do NOT need to install: Node.js, pnpm, PostgreSQL, or Redis locally when working inside the Dev Container.

#### What's Included Inside the Container
- Node.js (project-supported version) & pnpm
- Git + ESLint + formatting/lint tooling
- PostgreSQL (development DB)
- Redis (cache + Bull/BullMQ queues)
- Any extra CLI utilities defined in the Dockerfile / config

PostgreSQL and Redis are started for you; the backend service can connect directly using default ports (or service hostnames, depending on compose layering).

#### Quick Start
1. Clone (If using windows, use WSL for best compatibility):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```
2. Copy env file in `.devcontainer` folder (do this BEFORE starting services):
   ```bash
   cd .devcontainer
   cp .env.example .env
   # adjust values as needed
   ```
3. Open folder in VS Code. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette → `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`).
4. Install workspace dependencies (usually auto-run, run manually if needed):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
5. Set up environment files for each service:
   ```bash
   # Set up backend environment
   cp apps/core-api/.env.example apps/core-api/.env
   
   # Set up frontend environment  
   cp apps/pwa/.env.example apps/pwa/.env.local
   ```
6. Start backend (core API):
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter core-api start:dev
   ```
7. Start frontend (in a second terminal):
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter pwa dev
   ```
8. Open the printed URLs in your browser.

#### Services & Ports (Defaults)
- PostgreSQL: 5432 (forward if you want external client access)
- Redis: 6379
Port forwarding can be configured via VS Code Ports view if you need host access, otherwise services remain internal.

#### Common Commands (Inside Container)
```bash
pnpm install                 # Install deps
pnpm --filter core-api start:dev   # Backend dev server
pnpm --filter pwa dev        # Frontend dev server
pnpm lint                    # Lint all packages
pnpm test                    # Run test suite
```

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

We use a three-branch strategy:

- **`main`**: Production-ready stable code
- **`dev`**: Development branch for active development
- **`prd`**: Production staging branch

### Branch Naming Strategy

Use the format: `<type>/<short-description>` with lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.

#### Branch Types

- **`feature/`** - New features: `feature/donation-tracking`
- **`fix/`** - Bug fixes: `fix/payment-validation-error`
- **`hotfix/`** - Critical production fixes (from `main`): `hotfix/security-vulnerability`
- **`refactor/`** - Code improvements: `refactor/donation-service-cleanup`
- **`docs/`** - Documentation: `docs/api-documentation`
- **`chore/`** - Maintenance: `chore/update-dependencies`
- **`test/`** - Testing: `test/donation-api-coverage`

#### Guidelines

- Be descriptive but concise (max 50 characters)
- Use hyphens, not underscores or spaces
- Include issue numbers: `feature/123-add-donation-goals`
- Use present tense verbs: `add`, `fix`, `update`, `remove`

#### Creating Branches

```bash
git checkout dev && git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Workflow

1. Create feature branches from `dev`
2. Develop and test your changes
3. Submit PR to `dev` branch
4. After review and approval, changes are merged
5. Periodic releases move from `dev` → `main` → `prd`

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities


### ESLint

We use ESLint for code quality and formatting:

```bash
# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Fix lint issues automatically
pnpm run lint:fix

```

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- Write unit tests for all services and utilities
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Include E2E tests for critical user flows
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm run test

# E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# Test coverage
pnpm run test:cov

# Watch mode during development
pnpm run test:watch
```

### Testing Structure

```typescript
// Example unit test
describe('DonationService', () => {
  let service: DonationService;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({
      providers: [DonationService],
    }).compile();

    service = module.get<DonationService>(DonationService);
  });

  it('should create donation campaign', async () => {
    const createDto = { /* test data */ };
    const result = await service.create(createDto);
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting (no code changes)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash

## Issue Reporting

We use structured GitHub Issue Forms to streamline triage. When opening a new issue, select the template that best fits:

Template Types
- 🐞 Bug Report – Reproducible defects or regressions
- ✨ Feature Request – New capabilities aligned with the mission
- 🛠 Improvement / Refactor – Code quality, performance, DX improvements
- 📝 Documentation Update – README / guides / inline docs corrections
- ❓ Question – Targeted, answerable questions (use Discussions for open-ended topics)

General Guidelines
- Search existing issues & discussions before filing
- One focused issue per ticket
- Provide minimal reproducible examples for bugs
- Clearly state user/business value for features
- Mark breaking changes and migration needs

Security
- DO NOT file public issues for vulnerabilities—use the private security contact listed in the issue chooser.

Triage Process
1. New issues get `needs-triage`
2. Maintainers classify (add labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `refactor`, `documentation`, etc.)
3. Priority assigned (`p0`, `p1`, `p2`) where applicable
4. Milestone set (optional) and assignee added when work is accepted
